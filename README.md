# CICD

## **What is CI/CD?**

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are related to the software development cycle and allow for the rapid and smooth integration of code into a single program. Continuous Integration focuses on safe and regular synthesis of code by requiring devlopers to commit to the main branch of a shared repository regularly and early. When code is pushed to the main branch, it undergoes a series of automated tests and is verified by an automated build ensuring errors can be identfied frequently. Continuous delivery focuses on the frequency of deployment. It ensures code is prepared to deploy to any environment at any time. These deployments can be triggered manually or automatically using continuous deployment, which is a process that releases code once a predetermined criteria is met. CI/CD automates testing processes and builds and ensures code is released quickly. 


## **CICD Tools and Why They Are Used**
CICD tools are used to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery by automating CICD workflows or 'pipelines'. They supporting integration, testing and deployment. A few popular CICD tools include:
- Jenkins
- BitBucket Pipelines
- AWS Code Pipeline
- Circle CI
- Azure Pipelines
- GitLab
- Atlassian Bamboo
